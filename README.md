Project Title
The Only Sport Stuyvesant is Good at- Chess

Project Idea
We want to create a working 2-player chess game in NetLogo. This is similar to online chess games where two people play against each other in real-time.
We need to be able to set up the board with all the pieces.
-Each piece will have moves specific to itself, that other pieces cannot perform
-Each piece will have a specific shape
-Each team will have differing colors
The board will be set up in a checkerboard fashion.

Critical Features
Pieces
-Must be able to move within the board
-Must be able to capture pieces of the opposite color
-Must be able to calculate where they can move within the board, not being able to go off the board or onto other pieces

Board
-When a piece is clicked on, its possible moves will be highlighted on the board with green.
-When one of the green patches is clicked on, the piece must move there and if necessary, kill the current piece that is there
-The board must be set up in a typical checkerboard fashion

General
-Only one player must be allowed to go at a time, with the players alternating turns
-A monitor that displays who’s turn it is
To be Added Later Features
Make pawns able to be turned into queens/bishops/knights/rooks.
Make monitor for each dead pieces.
Make the computer calculate when checkmate has happened, ending the game.
Enable castling when the king and the rook involved have never moved.
Make a timer for each player that limits the playing time of each to 5 minutes.
 
Development Stages
Phase 1
Setup the board, with all the pieces in their correct locations and with their correct elements. Pieces will be turtles, and each square on the board will be a patch. Each piece will need to have a specific breed, and turtles will need a variable that tells which team they are on.
Phase 2
Have all turtles able to calculate what moves are possible for them. Once a piece is clicked on, it will read the board and cause its moves to be highlighted in green (this includes its possible captures). Each type of piece (breed) will need specific coding for it to calculate how it moves.
Phase 3
Once a piece has calculated out where all it can move, it must be able to move to the position that the user decides. This means that when the user clicks on a highlighted tile, the piece will move to that patch. Once this is completed, the project will be able to work.
Phase 4
Refine the piece’s moves. They shouldn’t be able to jump over other pieces (with the exception of the knight), and they can’t be allowed to go off the board. Essentially, only possible moves will show up in green.
Phase 5
This phase is unlikely to be completed, but if we have extra time it would enhance the project. We will add in all the extra features listed above, such as timers, castling, promotions of pawns, etc.
